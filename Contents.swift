//import UIKit

//
////I created a variable called placeholder, and I put the String (Red Thing) inside placeHolder
////var placeHolder = "Hi! I have not had nearly enough coffee this morning"
//
////function; and your arguments go inside the parentheses
////print(placeHolder)
//
////print("Hi Brandi")
////print("Hi Corey")
////print("Hi Sara")
//
////Idea: Design our code to be able to take anything we want to say, and put what we want to say out on the console. Our first function:
////camelcase: spaces are bad, so when we name something, make it one word.
////first word not capitalized, everyword after: capitalized
////insde (): your parameters: what goes into the function'
//// : -> "of type"
//
//
////we made our function here
//func outputName(userInput: String) {
//    //our function goes here
//    print("\(userInput)")
//}
//
////test our function
//var test = "It is raining, and I thought Miami would be sunny."
//outputName(userInput: test)
//

//var favoriteFood = "Taco Bell"
//
//if favoriteFood == "Chipotle" {
//    print("You choose")
//} else if favoriteFood == "Starbucks" {
//    print("My fave food is not Starbucks")
//} else if favoriteFood == "BurgerKing" {
//    print("My fave food is indeed Burger King")
//} else {
//    print("My favorite food was \(favoriteFood)")

//Code Challenge:
//Write a FUNCTION called gradeChecker that takes in a number called testscore, and checks prints out a letter grade:
//A: 90 - 100; 95 -> A
//B: 80 - 89; 86 -> B
//C: 70 - 79; 72 -> C
//D: 60 - 69; 61 -> D
//F: anything below a 60 -> F
//how do you represent numbers? Which data type represents numbers?
//extension: make your function print out the original score, along with the letter grade

//collections: a way we collect data
var name1 = "Shannon"
var name2 = "Jennifer"
var name3 = "Amber"

//declare an array
var myNames = [String]()

//we added a bunch of stuff to an array
myNames.append(name1)
myNames.append(name2)
myNames.append(name3)
//print(myNames)

//we will pull out data from an array
myNames[2]

//Code Challenge: Make an array that holds 6 of your favorite
//hobbies, in decreasing order; Pos. 0: Most Important; Pos. 5 would be the least important
//Share your most important hobby, with the person next to you

var myHobbies = [String]()

myHobbies.append("KickBoxing")
myHobbies.append("Painting")
myHobbies.append("Jetskiing")
myHobbies.append("Girlscouting")
myHobbies.append("Dancing")
myHobbies.append("sleep")
